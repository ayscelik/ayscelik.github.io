To run our website, click the link found under the release tab. This will run the website using the Jekyll theme we used for our website.

If you like to see where our main code is within this github page, please see tags.html file (ayscelik.github.io/tags.html). To see the images uploaded to the website, please see Pictures file (ayscelik.github.io/assets/Pictures/). To see the code written in css, please see mystyle.css file (ayscelik.github.io/assets/css/mystyle.css).

If you want to run the website locally without needing to run through our repository, then you can download the Local Website zip folder. When you unzip the folder, make sure to keep the resulting files (Pictures folder, css sheet) in the same place as the html file. This is so that when you locally run the html file it can access the necessary data from the rest of the files in folder. Both ways of running the website require an internet connection for the protein search tool to work.

Note: the locally run version of the website will not include the aboutme section or the front page since these are tied to the Jekyll version. The local version will only allow you to see and use the protein search tool.

Thank you for using our project!
